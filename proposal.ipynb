    "We will utilize IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews), to explore the effects on a sentiment analysis problem for different combinations of the following parameters: \n",
    " - type of recurrent neural network (LSTM vs GRU),\n",
    " - number of neurons per layer,\n",
    " - batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize a model composed as follows: \n",
    " - 3 recurrent layers (either LSTM or GRU),\n",
    " - 3 dense layer, \n",
    " - ReLU activation function with He initializer for the first 5 layers, \n",
    " - the output layer will utilize a sigmoid function for activation and will be initialized with Glorot,\n",
    " - the loss function will be binary crossentropy,\n",
    " - as optimizer we will utilize Adam (but time permitting we might try exploring different options),\n",
    " - we aim to train each model for 100 epochs but we reserve to lower this parameter for time/computational constraints or increase it if more training is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take advantage of the preprocessing steps carried on in this article 'Python for NLP: Movie Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning in Keras' (https://stackabuse.com/python-for-nlp-movie-sentiment-analysis-using-deep-learning-in-keras/) up to the generation of the embedding layer. This will allow us to focus on the tuning of our model rather then go through the time consuming efforts of analysis and pre-processing from the scratch."
